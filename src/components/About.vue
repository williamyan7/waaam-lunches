        <ol>
          <li>Register an account with your Wharton email</li>
          <li>Fill out your profile information, including uploading a photo. Your default status is "active" meaning you are open to being paired (switch this off when you want to stop being paired)</li>
          <li>Every other Sunday, you will receive an email notifying you that you have been assigned a new buddy</li>
          <li>Go to the "Current Pairing" tab to see your buddy's information, and email them to meet up!</li>
          <li>Once you've met, make sure you mark yourself as having met your buddy on the "Edit Profile" page so you can be assigned a new one (if you haven't met you will not be assigned a new one)</li>
